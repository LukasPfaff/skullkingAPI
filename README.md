# skullkingAPI

This project is planned to serve as a backend for my [SkullKing notepad](https://github.com/LukasPfaff/skull-king-v2) web application so it can be adjusted to show old games and player statistics. 
It was created using the Java Spring Framework and connects to a PostgreSQL Database.
